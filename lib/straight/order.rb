module Straight

  # This module should be included into your own class to extend it with Order functionality.
  # For example, if you have a ActiveRecord model called Order, you can include OrderModule into it
  # and you'll now be able to do everything to check order's status, but you'll also get AR Database storage
  # funcionality, its validations etc.
  #
  # The right way to implement this would be to do it the other way: inherit from Straight::Order, then
  # include ActiveRecord, but at this point ActiveRecord doesn't work this way. Furthermore, some other libraries, like Sequel,
  # also require you to inherit from them. Thus, the module.
  #
  # When this module is included, it doesn't actually *include* all the methods, some are prepended (see Ruby docs on #prepend).
  # It is important specifically for getters and setters and as a general rule only getters and setters are prepended.
  #
  # If you don't want to bother yourself with modules, please use Straight::Order class and simply create new instances of it.
  # However, if you are contributing to the library, all new funcionality should go to either Straight::OrderModule::Includable or
  # Straight::OrderModule::Prependable (most likely the former).
  module OrderModule

    # Only add getters and setters for those properties in the extended class
    # that don't already have them. This is very useful with ActiveRecord for example
    # where we don't want to override AR getters and setters that set attribtues.
